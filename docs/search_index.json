The larger group from which subjects were selected from for example all the students in HSP Sample A sample is a subset of the population It is not practical or feasible to have an entire population in a study. As such we take a group of subjects from the population. For example, n participants signed up for HSP study. Variable A variable is any property/characteristic that may have different values depending on condition Height, weight, reaction time, drug dosage Independent variable (IV) The IV is the variable that is systematically manipulated by investigator A investigator is interested in effects of alcohol on social behaviour. The IV is the amount of alcohol given. Because it is manipulated by the investigator, it is the IV. Dependent variable (DV) The DV in an experiment is the variable that investigator measures to determine effect of IV Sticking with the IV example, the DV could be amount of time on the dance floor or something. Remember, it is called dependent because its results depends on the manipulation. Data The measurements that are made on the subjects of an experiment are called data Data set contains the DV and other stuff like age Statistic Statistic is a number calculated on a sample data that quantifies a characteristic of the sample The mean of a sample (average age of students in PSYC 218) Parameter A parameter is a number calculated on population data that quantifies a characteristic of the population The mean of entire population (average age of every student at UBC) 2.3 Random Sampling In most research, data is collected via a sample of subjects rather then the entire population for which the results are intended to apply. Ideally we can recruit every smoker to conduct an experiment on cardiovascular health but that is very impractical and very costly. As such, researchers take a random sample. This will be discussed more in Chap 8 but everyone in the population needs to have the same chance of being selected otherwise we cannot generalize the results to the population as the sample might be biased. When random sampling is conducted, we can have confidence that the results can be generalized to the population and therefore useful and worthwhile. 2.4 Descriptive and Inferential statistics This table highlights some of the major differences between descriptive and inferential statistics. Descriptive statistics Inferential statistics Describes the data Make predictions (inferences) from the sample and generalize them to the population Typically uses tables and graphs to present the data Probability scores used Describes the data that is already known Makes conclusion about the population that is beyond the available data Measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and spread (range, standard deviation) are common tools Parametric (T-test, ANOVA, regression) and Non-parametric (chi-square, kruskal-wallis) "],["basic-mathematical-and-measurment-concepts.html", "Chapter 3 Basic Mathematical and Measurment Concepts 3.1 Chapter learning objectives 3.2 Mathematical Notation 3.3 Summation 3.4 Measurement scales 3.5 Continuous and Discrete Variables", " Chapter 3 Basic Mathematical and Measurment Concepts 3.1 Chapter learning objectives 3.2 Mathematical Notation 3.3 Summation In statistics, summation is one of the most frequent operations performed. The algebraic phrase for summation is: \\[ \\sum_{i = 1}^{N}X_i \\] This reads “sum of the x variable from i =1 to N.” The term below (\\(i=1\\)) tells us the first score in the summation The Term above (\\(N\\)) tells us the last score in the summation This tells us that we are to add the X scores from the first score ending with the Nth score. Thus: \\[ \\sum_{i = 1}^{N}X_i = X_1 + X_2 + X_3 + ... X_N \\] The summation of age data in previous table: \\[ \\sum_{i = 1}^{N}X_i = X_1 + X_2 + X_3 + X_4 + X_5 + X_6 \\\\ = 8 + 10 + 7 + 6 + 10 + 12\\\\ = 53 \\] If we only want to sum the 2nd, 3rd, 4th, and 5th scores, we could would use: \\[ \\sum_{i = 2}^{55}X_i = X_2 + X_3 + X_4 + X_5 \\\\ = 10 + 7 + 6 + 10 \\\\ = 33 \\] 3.3.1 Summation in R Summation in R is very easy. Simply use the sum() function. Here are examples using the same age data. sum(8,10,7,6,10,12) ## [1] 53 sum(10,7,6,10) ## [1] 33 3.4 Measurement scales 3.4.1 Nominal Scales 3.4.2 Ordinal Scales 3.4.3 Ratio Scales 3.5 Continuous and Discrete Variables "],["methods.html", "Chapter 4 Methods", " Chapter 4 Methods We describe our methods in this chapter.

It is the average value and is sensitive to outliers. The symbol for sample mean is \\(\\bar{X}\\) and the equation form is: \\[ \\bar{X} = \\frac{\\sum{X_1}}{N} = \\frac{X_1 + X_2 + X_3 + ... + X_N}{N} \\] The calculations for the mean of the population is the same except the symbol for population is \\(\\mu\\) (Greek letter mu). \\[ \\mu = \\frac{\\sum{X_1}}{N} = \\frac{X_1 + X_2 + X_3 + ... + X_N}{N} \\] 7.3.1.1 Properties of the mean The mean has many important properties and characteristics: 1. The mean is sensitive to the exact value of all the scores in the distribution. To calculate the mean, you need to add all the scores. As such, a change in in any value will change the mean (unlike median and mode). 2. The sum of the deviations about the equals zero. Mathematically, this property becomes \\(\\sum(X_i - \\bar{X}) = 0\\). This states that if the mean is subtracted from each score, the sum of the differences will equal zero. 7.3.2 The Overall mean 7.3.3 The Median 7.3.4 The Mode 7.4 Measures of Variability 7.4.1 The Range 7.4.2 The Standard Deviation 7.4.3 The variance 7.5 Example in R In your textbook, it asks you to use SPSS to compute the mean, sd, variance, and range for the following set of mathematics exam scores.

Mathexam: 78, 65, 47, 38, 86, 57, 88, 66, 43, 95, 73, 82, 61 let’s start by creating a a variable for these numbers and call it math_exam. math_exam &lt;- c(78, 65, 47, 38, 86, 57, 88, 66, 43, 95, 73, 82, 61) In R, The function mean() and median() is used to compute the mean and median, respectively, The function sd() and var() is used to compute the standard deviation and variance, respectively. the function min(), max(), and range() is used to compute the minimum value, maximum value, and range, respectively. # What was the mean exam grade? mean(math_exam) ## [1] 67.61538 # What was median grade? median(math_exam) ## [1] 66 # What was the standard deviation? sd(math_exam) ## [1] 18.0764 # What was the varience? var(math_exam) ## [1] 326.7564 # What was the lowest grade? min(math_exam) ## [1] 38 # What was the highest grade? max(math_exam) ## [1] 95 # What was the lowest and the highest grade? range(math_exam) ## [1] 38 95 Alternatively, you can use the summary() function to display several statistic summaries. summary(math_exam) ## Min. 1st Qu.
